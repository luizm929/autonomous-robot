Autonomous-robot is a project to create an arduino
autonomous robot project. The project is mainly based
in c/c++ code but some parts may be in assembly in
order to either lower the default frequency the arduino
runs on or just make the code perform faster.

A FEW THINGS WORTH MENTIONING.
When using dc motors(wheels) and thermometers, I found out
that if you try to make them work together they really don't,
so In order to prevent the some kind of dcmotor/sensor mishandling
I used the aref pin on the arduino. and connected the sensor to 3.3v.
Although this feels counter intuitive (connectin 5.0v and 3.3v) it works.


The RGB LED's I am using, use one pin only. But the have a
few drawbacks mainly that you have to modify its function for
it to compute in as little time possible otherwise thermometer
the ultrasonic sensor will take longer to measure distance.
