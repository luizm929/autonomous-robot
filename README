Autonomous-robot is a project to create an arduino
autonomous robot. The project is mainly based
in c/c++ code but some parts may be in assembly.

A FEW THINGS WORTH MENTIONING.
When using dc motors(wheels) and thermometers, I found out
that if you try to make them work together in Arduino, they really don't,
so In order to prevent this I used the aref pin on the arduino
and connected the sensor to 3.3v.


The RGB LED's I am using, use one pin only. But there is a
few drawbacks mainly that you have to modify the loop(make it loop in less time) used  for
it to work in as little time possible otherwise thermometer
the ultrasonic sensor will take longer to measure distance.
