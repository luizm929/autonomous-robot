Autonomous-robot is a project to create an arduino 
autonomous robot project. The project is mainly based
in c/c++ code but some parts may be in assembly in 
order to either lower the default frequency the arduino
works in or just make the code perform faster.

A FEW THINGS WORTH MENTIONING.
When using dc motors(wheels) and thermometers, I found out 
that if you try to make them work together they really don't
so this is the reason I used aref pin in order for both 
dcmotors and thermometer the worth smoothly. 

The RGB LED's I am using, use one pin only. But the have a 
few drawbacks mainly that you have to modify the function for 
it to compute in as little time possible otherwise thermometer 
the ultrasonic sensor will take longer to measure distance
thus crashing everywhere.
